# SetFindr Website Deployment Guide

## Local Deployment

The SetFindr website is currently running on a local HTTP server. Here's how to access it:

### From the same computer
- Open a web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

### From other devices on the same network
1. Find your computer's IP address by running `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
2. On other devices (phones, tablets, etc.), open a browser and navigate to:
   `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000`
   (Replace YOUR_IP_ADDRESS with the actual IP address from step 1)

## Deployment Options for Public Access

To make the website accessible from anywhere (not just your local network), consider these options:

### Option 1: Use a tunneling service
- Install ngrok: `npm install -g ngrok`
- Run: `ngrok http 8000`
- Use the generated URL to access your site from anywhere

### Option 2: Deploy to a hosting service
- GitHub Pages (free, static sites only)
- Netlify (free tier available)
- Vercel (free tier available)
- Firebase Hosting (free tier available)

### Option 3: Deploy to a VPS
- Set up a Virtual Private Server with providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Linode
- Install a web server (Apache, Nginx)
- Upload your files and configure the server

## Current Deployment Status
